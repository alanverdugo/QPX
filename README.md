# QPX

# What does it do?
This is a program that uses the QPX Google API in order to look for flights according to your specifications.

# How can I use it?
First of all, this project is not very user friendly (that should change later). It is not a web or mobile application. For now, it is just a script that will send emails to you when your conditions are met. It can be very useful, but for now you will have to make some things in order to use it.

# Requirements:
-A valid QPX API key.
-Python 2.7
-Python modules:
    requests
    json
    sys
    email
    smtplib
    datetime
    getopt
